# GeneticAlgorithm
This is a project which I have worked on for personal reasons in order to show my proficancy in Java/Processing. My aim was to try and create an artifical intelegence. Sorry if it's a mess I've never coded professionally. The aim of the program is to create "creatures" which are aerodynamic while also meeting certain changeable size specifications.
